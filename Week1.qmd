## Ice Breaker Questions:

1. Name:

2. Major:

3. Night Owl or Early Bird?

4. Favorite thing you did this summer?

5. What is your favorite ice cream place in Bozeman?

\newpage

Your favorite ice cream place is an example of _categorical data_.

\vfill

__Questions #1:__ Given X out of 15 people picked sweet peaks. Assume that this is class is a reasonably representative sample of all MSU students.

- Is there a statistical distribution that corresponds to this framework (X out of 15)?

\vfill

- How do we estimate the proportion of students that preferred Sweet Peaks?

\vfill

- What about uncertainty in that estimate?

\vfill


\newpage

__Question #2:__ Do we believe there is an association between night owls and favorite ice cream shop?

\vfill

Let's create a table that summarizes this information.


\vfill

__Question #3:__ Assume we also have the number of times per week a person eats ice cream, can we write down a model that uses this information to predict the probability a person picks sweet peaks?
